# Golf Sucks

## Uh...
Bold statement? Maybe. But anyone who's played the game has definitely been humbled and come to the same conclusion
as me, "Wow, I suck at this." Don't worry my friend, there's hope!

## Ok I'm interested what is it?
While I can't tweak your swing (trust me you don't want me to) I can help you track your statistics off the tee 
and around the green. Inspired by Nike Golf 360 and more recently [TheGrint](https://www.thegrint.com/) in an effort
to improve my web dev skills I'm slowly putting this project together while maybe shaving some strokes off my golf game.

## So how's it going?
Thanks for asking! Currently it's very minimal with just a landing page and the beginnings of both a log in page
and a dashboard. My plans are to carve out the frond end first and both implement and learn backend technologies
afterwards. While I don't know if I'll actually ever launch the application I've definitely had fun so far. Thanks
for checking it out!
