# Golf Sucks
An application to help golfers keep track of their scorecards after a round of golf.
Affectionately named after the phrase nearly every golfer has uttered or at least thought:
"Golf sucks." Golfers can keep track of their practice sessions including what they worked on,
start and end time of the session, and a few notes about how it all went. Finally, golfers
can get a overview of how many rounds they've posted, lowest nine and eighteen scores, and how
many practice sessions they've logged.

## Motivation
Inspired by apps like the late Nike Golf 360 and [The Grint](https://www.thegrint.com/) I've always
enjoyed using an application to track my game while on the course. Naturally, I thought it'd be a 
fun and challenging project to create a Progressive Web Application that golfers can use while on
the course but also at home on a desktop or laptop post round.
